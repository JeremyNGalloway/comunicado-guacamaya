MILLENARY RESISTANCE.
MACAW
YEAR OF THE NEW SUN.
MONTH OF THE NEW BLOOD.
"We are not defenders of nature, we are nature"

Five centuries (529 years) of genocide, terricide, looting and violations of the territory of Abya Yala, five centuries of struggle and resistance. We have been alive for five hundred years, defending life with life itself. We have spirit and love, we dream of returning to clear days and following the paths in harmony and balance with our mother: the earth.

The so-called "Global North" with its civilizing project since 1492 and the creation of states obedient to North American imperialism, has turned Abya Yala into the great pantry of the misnamed natural resources. The United States with its military and political interventions, together with the neo-colonialism of extractivist companies, distributes the territory of Abya Yala as it pleases. It is their own governments that dictate laws and a whole system of genocidal networks that they themselves, sometimes behind closed doors and sometimes in front of the whole world, manage as they please. A complete world dictatorship.

This is how the states heirs to colonialism (the states of "America" ​​/ Abya Yala), corrupt and obedient, sell the territories they do not own, undertake thousands of outrages protected and endorsed by organizations that end up being themselves. As are the "Human Rights" commissions, NGOs, delegates for peace and, finally, everything is a corrupt and terrorist network of extractivist companies, multinationals and corporations. The former provide "solutions" to problems created by the latter. A perfect and macabre business.

Today, like yesterday, we say: enough! We have resisted with sticks, with arrows, with stones, with thought and spirit. We are not afraid because we have come from the earth and to it we return.

The so-called civilization implanted based on constant genocide and terricide to obtain "resources" is neither understandable nor fair. We understand life from the community, from the relationship with Mother Earth. For us, civilization is balance, harmony, life, health, peace. The accumulation of things in a few hands due to the murder of others does not make sense, nor does it make sense to allow this to continue. So, we understand that our task will be the defense of the territory, the water, the forests, the seas. In a few words: we defend life.

One of the territories fiercely affected by all this historical structure of looting is GUATEMALA. Areas such as El Estor, Izabal.

A story of struggle and resistance against looting, extractivism, the abuse of communities, the violation of all kinds of rights, true crimes against the land. A complete terricide.

In the 1960s, when the price of nickel was on the rise, the Guatemalan government granted licenses to multinational companies for its exploitation, which is how the Canadian International Company INCO began to commit crimes against the Q'eqchi population, through pollution of Lake Izabal. The lake is the source of food for the community.

Since then, this violence continues.
 
FACTS:

- Year 2007. The servile government and its military and police force, as well as the workers of the company today called Compañía Guatemalteca de Níquel S.A. (CNG). that controls the FENIX mining project, they evict five communities burning houses, shooting, stealing merchandise. It was on January 17 of that year, 2007, that hundreds of military policemen and security personnel from the FENIX mining company carried out not only the eviction of the population, but also took turns mass raping 11 women. These women had sued HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries: HMI Nickel Inc. and CGN. Companies that control the FENIX mining project.

- In 2009, Adolfo Ich Chaman was assassinated at the hands of the private security forces employed by the FENIX project in the vicinity of El Estor. On September 27, 2009, Adolfo, a community leader, went to some buildings near the mine, wanting to make sure there was no conflict between demonstrators and security guards. He did not carry weapons. When he got there, a group of men who worked as security guards at the mine attacked him with machetes and shot him in the head. He died from his injuries.

- In 2011 the mine changed hands again. Now, the Swiss company Solway Investment Group starts its operations through the subsidiary CGN.

- Year 2016. Explosion inside the mine due to low safety conditions for workers. It resulted in several of the miners being injured (more than twenty) and others dead. Low security conditions are evidence of the null importance that the company gives to life. Our brothers and sisters are seen as mere tools to extract the "resources" of our territories.

- We arrive, then, at the year 2017 when riot police shoot at the communities killing Carlos Maaz, an artisanal fisherman in the area. Here tensions increased between the Mayan Q'eqchi communities and the mining operations. After the events, several journalists such as Carlos Choc and Jerson Xitumul who reported the events and carried out investigations have been criminalized. Carlos had to go through medical complications as he went into hiding, while Jerson was imprisoned in one of the most dangerous prisons in the country. In addition, several fishermen were accused of charges only granted to organized crime.

- Year 2019. The Constitutional Court (CC) temporarily suspended the operations of the CGN, for not having carried out a consultation with the communities located in the impact zone, as ordered by ILO Convention 169. However, the company never stopped its operations.

- Year 2021. The process of designing the consultation with the community begins, when this should have been prior to the mining installation and operation. They excluded the Q'eqchi authorities from the pre-consultation process - as if they were not the main affected - a reason that leads the communities to take to the streets and stop the flow of raw materials from the mine. The exclusion is part of a rigging strategy between the MEM, CGN, governments and farmers who seek to consult only with people linked to the mining company, or located in the urban area of ​​El Estor who support extraction. Until October 2021, the use of repressive and brutal force attacks the Q'eqchi people, with shooting, forced evictions and criminalization of their Q'eqchi authorities, air and ground attacks, intimidation, with the Guatemalan national police in favor of the CGN.

- The artisanal fishermen and the unpunished death of the three UVG students in the mines are added to the list of those persecuted and killed for being against pollution and abuse.

- The mine pollutes not only the lake but also the air. During the nights and early mornings, the Pronico boilers expel red smoke that spreads wherever the wind blows. Also "a reddish mantle" that extends over the lake.


MAGIC CARPET CASE

The Solway mining company is part of the Russian, Kazakh, Israeli and Ukrainian network involved in the Magic Carpet scandal. People from the Guatemalan government have received millionaire bribes in favor of the mining and port interests of the Mayaniquel mining company, territorially neighboring the FENIX mining project in Solway. Russian directors of Mayaniquel are also directors of Solway and its subsidiary CGN in Guatemala.

As of today (March 2022), the company's police and security forces have "ceased" their harassment of the communities, which does not mean that the mining company is going to stop extraction, or that the company is going to to close. It will continue to pollute the air, the water, the land and cause irreparable damage to the entire ecosystem. Very surely when there is a hint of protest or denunciation, it will act, as it has been its regular conduct until now, with violence and repression. The non-presence of repressive forces at this time is no guarantee of anything for the communities and the ecosystem of the territory.

This is a clear example and reason to act like Macaw. For our dead, for our ancestors, for the territory, for life, for the land, reparation and justice! We break into their tech systems and hack. We infiltrate its entrails. In this way we seek reparation knowing that the damage caused to the earth and to people is irreparable, but know that we will be there to demand accounts.

Enough of so much impunity!

Macaw we are all. From north to south of our land of lifeblood. We are in schools, universities, in homes, in the mountains and in the jungles.

As seen in the video [1], hacking is not magic and does not require a lot of resources or very advanced technical knowledge. It was all done with free open source tools that anyone can learn to master. Just filter and sabotage with joyous rebellion!

We demand:

1. The immediate cessation of mining extraction.
2. The return of the territory to the community.

And although these measures will not restore well-being to the earth, nor the dead or human dignity, it will serve to honor our Pachamama and our ancestors, to provide a light for those who come and to continue in resistance defending life.
